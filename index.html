 <h1>Delicious Bites Menu</h1>

    <h2>Appetizers</h2>  

  <ul>     

   <li>          

  <strong>Caprese Salad</strong>       

     <p>Fresh tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil drizzled with balsamic glaze.</p> 

       </li>    

       <li>
        <strong>Mexican Fiesta Bites </strong>
        <p>Like mini tostadas, thin pretzel crisps are piled high with refried beans, guacamole, salsa, sour cream, and more! Lutzflcat describes them as "creamy, one-bite hors d'oeuvres packed with fresh flavor."
            </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>Marvelous Mini Mexican Quiches
        </strong>
        <p>Easy to make and always a hit, these Mexican mini-quiches are bursting with flavor. "This is truly amazing," says SamSmidgett. "Although they are so good on their own, I dipped them in a little hot sauce and it made them POP. Man alive they went quickly. Make a double batch!"</p>
       </li>

   </ul>  

  <h2>Main Courses</h2> 

   <ul>   

     <li>      

      <strong>Grilled Salmon</strong>     

       <p>Salmon fillet seasoned and grilled to perfection, served with lemon butter sauce.</p>   

     </li>     

     <li>
        <strong>Creamy Asparagus and Mushroom Pasta</strong>
        <p>This creamy asparagus and mushroom pasta is a delicious meatless main dish for 4, or a fantastic side for 6, great to go with chicken or chops. A tossed green salad and some garlic bread go nicely with this.</p>
     </li>
     <li>
        <strong>Shrimp Biryani
        </strong>
        <p>This shrimp biryani is aromatic and complex, homey and comforting. A mixture of spices, bloomed in ghee, flavor both the rice and tomato sauce, and the entire dish is baked layered with spiced yogurt-marinated shrimp.</p>
     </li>

   </ul>   

 <h2>Desserts</h2>  

  <ul>     

   <li>    

        <strong>Chocolate Fondue</strong>     

       <p>Assorted fruits and marshmallows served with rich chocolate fondue.</p>    

    </li>    

    <li>
        <strong>Bougatsa
        </strong>
        <p>Bougatsa, a Greek pastry that's delicious for breakfast or anytime, has a creamy but sturdy lemon-vanilla custard baked between layers of crisp and flaky phyllo dough.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Margarita Bars
        </strong>
        <p>These margarita bars are perfectly sweet, and oh, so creamy. The filling is like a cross between Key lime pie and a lemon bar, with a hint of tequila.
